    "In computer vision, machines can read text in natural scenes by first detecting text regions, cropping those regions, and subsequently recognizing text in those regions. The vision task of recognizing text from the cropped regions is called Scene Text Recognition (STR). STR makes it possible to read road signs, billboards, logos, and printed objects such as text on shirts, paper bills, etc. STR applications include practical use cases such as self-driving cars, augmented reality, retail analysis, education, devices for the visually impaired, and others."
