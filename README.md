# Optical Charactor Recgnition(OCR)
OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition and refers to a software technology that electronically identifies text (written or printed) inside an image file or physical document, such as a scanned document, and converts it into a machine-readable text form to be used for data processing.

In short, optical character recognition software helps convert images or physical documents into a searchable form. Examples of OCR are text extraction tools, PDF to .txt converters, and Googleâ€™s image search function.

# Scene Text Recognition(STR)
In computer vision, machines can read text in natural scenes by first detecting text regions, cropping those regions, and subsequently recognizing text in those regions. The vision task of recognizing text from the cropped regions is called Scene Text Recognition (STR). STR makes it possible to read road signs, billboards, logos, and printed objects such as text on shirts, paper bills, etc. STR applications include practical use cases such as self-driving cars, augmented reality, retail analysis, education, devices for the visually impaired, and others.
