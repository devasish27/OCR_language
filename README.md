# Optical Charactor Recgnition(OCR)
OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition and refers to a software technology that electronically identifies text (written or printed) inside an image file or physical document, such as a scanned document, and converts it into a machine-readable text form to be used for data processing.

In short, optical character recognition software helps convert images or physical documents into a searchable form. Examples of OCR are text extraction tools, PDF to .txt converters, and Googleâ€™s image search function.


# Scene Text Recognition(STR)
In computer vision, machines can read text in natural scenes by first detecting text regions, cropping those regions, and subsequently recognizing text in those regions. The vision task of recognizing text from the cropped regions is called Scene Text Recognition (STR). STR makes it possible to read road signs, billboards, logos, and printed objects such as text on shirts, paper bills, etc. STR applications include practical use cases such as self-driving cars, augmented reality, retail analysis, education, devices for the visually impaired, and others.


# The Process of OCR
In the following, we will show how optical character recognition works and explain the main steps of traditional OCR technologies.

1. Scanning the Document
2. Refining the Image
3. Binarization
4. Recognizing the Characters
5. Verifying the Accuracy

After the successful recognition of characters, the results are cross-referenced by utilizing the internal dictionaries of the OCR software to ensure accuracy. Measuring OCR accuracy is done by taking the output of an analysis conducted by an OCR and comparing it to the contents of the original version. There are two typical methods for analyzing the accuracy of OCR software: Character-level accuracy, counting how many characters were detected correctly. Word-level accuracy, counting how many words were recognized correctly.

# Tesseract OCR
Tesseract is a character recognition engine that can read scanned text and convert it into digital text. It is open-source software that is released under the Apache License 2.0. Tesseract is available for various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. Hence, Tesseract is a popular tool to recognize text in images, such as scanned documents and digital photos. Tesseract is accurate and efficient, and it can handle a variety of languages
